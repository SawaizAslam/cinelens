**Cazem** is an intelligent, multimodal movie identification platform. Think of it as Shazam, but for movies. Instead of audio, Cazem uses the power of **Google Gemini 3.0** to analyze visual scenes, dialogue snippets, and screenshots to instantly identify films with high accuracy.

It doesn't just give you a title; Cazem acts as a cinematic detective, providing context, cast details, ratings, and where to stream, all wrapped in a premium, responsive interface.

## 🚀 Features

-   **📸 Visual Recognition**: Snap a photo or upload a screenshot of any movie scene. Cazem analyzes actors, setting, lighting, and costumes to identify the film.
-   **💬 Dialogue Matching**: Type in a quote (even if you misremember it!), and Cazem will find the movie it belongs to.
-   **🤖 Powered by Gemini 3.0**: Leveraging the latest multimodal AI for superior reasoning and context awareness.
-   **🎬 Rich Metadata**: Instant access to posters, backdrops, cast, directors, release years, and ratings via TMDB integration.
-   **✨ Smart Recommendations**: Discover similar movies based on the "vibe" and visual style of your identified film.
-   **📱 Responsive Design**: A "Cinematic" dark-mode UI built with Tailwind v4 that looks great on desktop and mobile.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

-   **Frontend**: React 19, Vite
-   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4, Lucide React (Icons)
-   **AI Engine**: Google Gemini API (`gemini-2.5-pro` & `gemini-1.5-flash` variants)
-   **Data Provider**: TMDB (The Movie Database) API
-   **Deployment**: Vercel (recommended)

## 🏁 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
-   Node.js (v18 or higher)
-   npm or yarn
-   A **Google Gemini API Key**
-   A **TMDB API Key**

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cazem.git
    cd cazem
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API keys:
    ```env
    VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
    VITE_TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key_here
    VITE_TMDB_BASE_URL=https://api.themoviedb.org/3
    ```

4.  **Run the Development Server**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## 💡 How It Works

1.  **Select Input Mode**: Choose between "Upload Scene", "Use Camera", or "Dialogue".
2.  **Submit Query**: 
    -   *Upload/Camera*: The image is sent to Gemini 3.0 for visual analysis.
    -   *Dialogue*: The text is analyzed for semantic matches in movie scripts.
3.  **Verification**: The AI's identification is cross-referenced with TMDB to ensure the movie exists and to fetch high-quality metadata.
4.  **Results**: View the identified movie, its details, and get curated recommendations.

## 🚧 Challenges & Roadmap

### Challenges We Faced
-   **API Rate Limits**: One critical challenge was the scene upload feature. Initial implementations hit API rate limits almost instantly due to high-resolution image uploads. We implemented optimization strategies and better error handling to manage quotas effectively.
-   **Hallucinations**: Early AI models would guess generic scenes incorrectly. We refined our system prompts to force the AI to look for specific identifying details (props, background actors) before making a guess.

### What's Next
-   [ ] **Optimizing Scene Upload Pipeline**: Refactoring the upload process to be 100% reliable and edge-case resistant against API limits.
-   [ ] **Watchlist**: Save identified movies to a personal list.
-   [ ] **Social Challenges**: "Guess the Scene" daily games generated by AI.
